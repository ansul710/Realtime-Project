This is most minimal example of how to use Django Channels to create a Real Time application.
Django starts reverse countdown from 10 to 0, and send them to the frontend via opened WebSocket connection.
And these numbers are rendered in real time without any actions from the User. Confetti is just used to make the frontend look better!!
