This video is the most minimal example of how to use Django Channels to create a Real Time application.
Django generates numbers from 0 to 100, and send them to the frontend via opened WebSocket connection.
And these numbers are rendered in real time without any actions from the User.

Minimum of JavaScript code.
Minimum of Python code.
Minimum of HTML.
Just the core idea of how to use Websockets with Django.
